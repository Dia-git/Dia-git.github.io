## About Me 👩🏻‍💻

Hi, I’m **Diana**, a *junior data analyst*.

I combine a strong background in **biological sciences** and **bioinformatics** with **practical data analytics skills** (R · SQL · Excel · Tableau · Python) to transform complex datasets into clear, actionable insights, especially in **health, genomics, and biomedical research**.

I recently completed an **intensive Data Analytics Certification (DAC™, BrainStation)** where I built end-to-end analytical solutions using SQL, Excel, and Tableau, including a health data capstone project.

I have professional experience in **open-access scientific publishing** at *Frontiers in AI* and *Frontiers in Big Data*, where I support authors and editors in publishing peer-reviewed research, especially in **Medicine and Public Health**, giving me insight into research workflows, quality controls, and data interpretation.

My passions lie at the intersection of **data, biology, and human health**, and I am actively applying for roles in **health data analytics, bioinformatics analysis, data scientist support, and research analytics**.


- 🎓 Studied biology focusing on computational and cancer research.
- 📊 Passionate about **biological data visualization**, **bioinformatics workflows**, and **biomedical data science**.
- 💡 Currently expanding skills in **Python**, **R**, and **SQL** for data analytics and visualization.
- 🧬 Experienced in **data-driven content strategy**, **journal analytics**, and **scientific publishing**.
